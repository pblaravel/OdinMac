# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- **macOS 12 Monterey and Intel (x86_64) support.** The deployment target is
  12.0. `build.sh`, the Xcode project, and the Heimdall rebuild script now
  target the host architecture (`arm64` or `x86_64`) instead of hard-coding
  Apple Silicon and macOS 13. Release ZIP/PKG names include the built
  architecture (`macOS-arm64` or `macOS-x86_64`). The installer accepts that
  architecture and macOS 12+. Homebrew setup uses `/usr/local` on Intel and
  `/opt/homebrew` on Apple Silicon.

### Changed

- Removed the macOS 13-only `.windowResizability` SwiftUI API. Window size is
  still locked through AppKit in `AppDelegate`.
- `build.sh` refuses to bundle a Heimdall binary that has no slice for the
  current CPU, and rebuilds it automatically when libusb is available.
- Replaced a few newer SF Symbols on the Root tab with symbols present on
  macOS 12.

## v1.1.5

### Fixed

- **Flashing on macOS now uses a single Odin session.** Previously, when a
  firmware set had no PIT, OdinMac ran `download-pit` and then `flash` as two
  separate Heimdall processes — i.e. two Odin sessions. Many devices refuse the
  second session (`Protocol initialisation failed` / a hung `Beginning
  session`), so the flash failed even though the PIT download had succeeded.
  OdinMac now flashes in one session and lets Heimdall download the device PIT
  internally, mapping each image to a partition by its PIT flash filename.
- **Bundled Heimdall now detaches the macOS CDC ACM kernel driver.** Modern
  Samsung devices present Download Mode as a CDC ACM ("Gadget Serial")
  interface that macOS auto-binds `AppleUSBCDCACM` to, which made
  `set_interface_alt_setting` fail with "Setting up interface failed!". The
  bundled Heimdall only detached kernel drivers on Linux; it now does so on
  macOS too (`libusb_set_auto_detach_kernel_driver`, supported by libusb
  1.0.30).

### Heimdall patches

- `patches/heimdall-macos-kernel-detach.patch` — detach the kernel driver on
  macOS before claiming the interface.
- `patches/heimdall-flash-by-filename.patch` — let `flash` match files to PIT
  entries by flash filename and skip files the device PIT does not define
  (instead of aborting), enabling single-session flashing.

## v1.1.4

### Fixed

- **Detection regression from v1.1.3**: the IOKit USB check built a matching
  dictionary with an `idVendor` key and passed it to
  `IOServiceGetMatchingServices`. That style of property match silently
  returns nothing on macOS, so the two-stage gate (`onBus && heimdall detect`)
  always evaluated to `false` and **suppressed all device detection**, even
  when `heimdall detect` succeeded on its own. Replaced it with a registry
  enumeration that reads each USB device node's `idVendor` / `idProduct`
  directly (verified against a real device: VID 0x04E8, PID 0x685D).
- IOKit is now an **OR** signal alongside `heimdall detect`, never a gate in
  front of it — a failure in either path can no longer hide a connected
  device. Detection also now recognizes Download Mode product IDs
  (0x6601, 0x685D, 0x68C3) directly from the registry.
- Reworded the stalled-transfer guidance to name the real cause (USB signal
  integrity) and the fixes that actually work: cold-boot into Download Mode,
  a known-good data cable, and a USB 2.0 port / powered USB 2.0 hub.

## v1.1.3

### Fixed

- **Device detection on macOS 15+ (Sequoia / Tahoe)**: replaced the
  `heimdall detect` subprocess-only poll with a two-stage approach.
  Stage 1 uses IOKit directly from Swift (`IOServiceGetMatchingServices`
  on `IOUSBHostDevice`/`IOUSBDevice`, matching Samsung VID 0x04E8) to
  check whether any Samsung device is visible on the USB bus — no
  interface claim needed, no subprocess, works even when the accessory
  hasn't been approved yet. Stage 2 only runs `heimdall detect` when
  stage 1 finds something, confirming the device is in Download Mode.
- Added a `usbBusPresent` signal so the log shows
  "Samsung device detected on USB bus — waiting for Download Mode
  response" when the device is on USB but not yet responding to the
  Odin handshake.
- **Setup view now shows USB Accessories row** on macOS 15+, explaining
  the "Allow Accessory to Connect?" approval dialog and providing an
  "Open Settings" button that navigates directly to Privacy & Security.
- Added `-framework IOKit` to `build.sh` linker flags.

## v1.1.2

### Fixed

- USB pipe stall errors (`pipe is stalled`, `bulk transfer failed`) and
  `Failed to begin session` failures now correctly trigger the
  "disconnect, re-enter Download Mode, reconnect" guidance instead of
  showing a raw Heimdall error. Previously only `Setting up interface failed`
  and `Claiming interface failed` were caught.
- Flash errors now run the same reconnect-required check as PIT download
  errors, so the helpful reconnect message appears on the **first** failure
  instead of only on a subsequent retry.

## Unreleased

### Added

- `.pkg` installer (`scripts/build-pkg.sh`, wired into `scripts/release.sh`)
  that installs OdinMac to `/Applications`, clears the quarantine flag, and
  opens the app automatically when installation finishes.
- Setup & Requirements dialog now checks for Homebrew, Gatekeeper quarantine
  state, and admin account status, with one-click buttons to install
  Homebrew (handling its root-vs-admin-password requirements automatically)
  or clear the quarantine flag, then re-verifies each fix.
